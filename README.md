## Neighbourhood Map Project

A Udacity project to map Barbecue Places in Austin.This single page application follows the MVVM design pattern using Knockout.

Preface - If your are new to Austin, you might wanna find out about the different BBQ places in Austin. The Breakfast Taco war with San Antonio has been long and shows no sign of finding a victor anytime soon. However when it comes to BBQ, the winner is unanimous (but within the state lines only).


## Dependencies
To run the web app simply:
1 - clone the repo
2 - on your command line, run bower install
    (if you don't have bower, install it from https://bower.io/#getting-started)

There are only 2 dependencies for the app to run - Knockout and jQuery. The application uses Google Map APIs and Foursquare APIs to fetch the information of the specified locations. All network calls are made asynchronously.
